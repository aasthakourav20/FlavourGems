### Getting started
The following environment variable are necessary for configuring the project in your local -

1. Azure
Step 1: Create an Azure account
You must have an azure storage account for the project.
Images are stored as a blob in azure. So we need to have a blob container which we would access through our access keys
If you are a student then you can sign up for a $100 free credit on azure here.

2. Creating a new Resource
3. Fill the form 
A form is displayed. You only need to fill in the type of subscription and the name of storage account.
Leave rest to default. Then go to the resource and search for access keys.

4. Choose connnection string
   After clicking the access keys, we can see our storage account name and connection string (there are two of them, choose anyone)

5.  Setting up container
    As a last step in the resource page, you have to set up the container where we would store the images.
    In your newly created storage acc dashboard, click on the blob storag
    You must see a page where you can create a new container. Remember this name as we need it
